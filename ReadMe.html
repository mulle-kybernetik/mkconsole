<p>Normally you only need the MkConsole application and can safely ignore/delete the other files.</p>

<p>However, as an alternative you can also run MkConsoleElement which does not display an icon in the dock. If you do this you can launch the MkConsole application to change preferences and the StopElement script to stop the element.</p>


<h1>MkConsole 1.8</h1>

<p>This version of MkConsole requires Mac OS X 10.3 (Pather) or above. It will not work with earlier versions.</p>

<p>Changes in this version</p>

<ul>
<li>Logfiles are reopened when the computer wakes up from sleep. This should solve even the most persistent NFS issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes in version 1.7</p>

<p>This version of MkConsole requires Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) or above. It will not work with earlier versions.</p>

<ul>
<li>New preference to keep the MkConsole window on the desktop when using Expose. Thanks to Manfred Lippert for the patch!</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes in version 1.6</p>

<ul>
<li>New UI element that allows you to run the console without having an icon in your dock.</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes in version 1.5</p>

<ul>
<li>Click-through to desktop icons. The window is completely transparent, even the pixels covered by the actual text now ignore mouse-clicks.

<li>Window level option. In previous versions the console text was on the same level as the desktop icons which meant that it was displayed above some icons and below others and this setup would change depending on what you did. Now, you can choose whether the text is always below the icons (default) or always above them. 

<li>File creation date check on reopen. The entire contents of a given file are redisplayed if MkConsole discovers that its creation date has changed. This should solve the issue with the Folding at Home files.

<li>Link to the website from Help menu.
</ul>
