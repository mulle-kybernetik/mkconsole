	* v1.10

	* SCWatchdog.[hm]: added SCWatchdog class which posts notifications in
	  case the system configuration for IPv4 keys changes.

	* MKConsoleWindowController.m: changed implementation of
	  -_computerWokeUp: to call -_reopenReaders method with a delay of 5
	  seconds, this should give network mounts etc. a chance to be
	  available on time the readers are finally reopened. Also,
	  registered for SCWatchdogKeysDidChangeNotification and subsequent call
	  -_computerWokeUp: (which is a bit of a misnomer).

	* FactoryDefaults.plist: removed daily.log from default logfiles as
	  this is obsolete in 10.4.

	* MkConsole.xcodeproj: fixed "Development" and "Deployment" build
	  settings. "Development" will use default (current) SDK and
	  target settings, "Deployment" will use 10.4u SDK for i386 and PPC.
	  Added a new "Deployment 10.3" build setting which will use 10.3.9 SDK
	  for PPC and link accordingly. Finally, added a new "All" aggregate
	  target for building MkConsole and MkConsoleElement in one go.

	* MKConsoleWindowController.m: introduced new boolean default
	  "NoAlertOnOpenFailure" for logging logfile open errors instead of
	  raising an alert panel. Also, added new method
	  -setWindowFrameCleverly for setting the window frame on startup and
	  after waking from sleep. This method uses a simple heuristic to
	  find out whether the screen the logwindow used to be on has gone
	  in the meantime and tries to redisplay it in a somewhat clever way.
	  Please note that this method doesn't alter the saved value, so all
	  should be good in most cases!
